Thank you for registering for the 2020 ACMM HyperSpy workshop on data analysis 
in materials science.
This interactive workshop session will introduce you to modern techniques of
data analysis for materials science and microscopy data within the scientific
Python environment, with time for questions and individual help.
The ultimate goal for the session is that by its end, each attendee feels
comfortable using HyperSpy for basic imaging and hyperspectral data analysis,
and knows where to look for further help, if necessary.

There are a few useful links in the top header of this page. The first
(`Workshop Repository <https://github.com/ericpre/hyperspy_tutorial>`_)
will take you to the git repository containing the notebooks and data we will
use during the tutorial. The next two point to the HyperSpy
`Homepage <http://hyperspy.org>`_ and
`User Guide <http://hyperspy.org/hyperspy-doc/current/index.html>`__,
respectively. The homepage contains general information about the project as
a whole, while the User Guide is an extensive piece of documentation that explains
how to use HyperSpy for all sorts of analyses. Feel free to refer
to these links before and during the workshop session for additional help.

Pre-workshop instructions
-------------------------

Please review this section in advance of Sunday's workshop session, as it
includes instructions for installing HyperSpy and the Jupyter interactive
computing environment.

..
    ..  admonition:: Installation alternatives

        While we encourage everyone to follow the instruction below to install
        HyperSpy locally on their personal system, we will also provide a web-based
        `JupyterHub`_ instance that can be used through a normal web browser,
        without installing anything to your system. If you choose to use this
        option, all you will need is a computer with a modern web browser (even a
        tablet with external keyboard should work). If you wish to use this option
        you will need a Google Account of some kind (either a NIST-administered one,
        which can be obtained
        `here <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/18vhcaRwq7MloEtz7-K75ZKKsGpgquhuVAteNkl5HTvg/viewform?edit_requested=true>`_
        or a personal account) for authentication purposes.

    ..  _JupyterHub: https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

No prior knowledge of Python is required for this workshop but a basic familiarity
with Python will be helpful. You will need to follow
the instructions below to install HyperSpy using either the Anaconda Python
distribution (Windows, Mac, or Linux), or the pre-compiled "bundle" installer
(only available on Windows).

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

At its core, HyperSpy is a third-party library that exists as part of the
scientific greater Python ecosystem (as opposed to a stand-alone application).
Because of this, installation is slightly more tricky than a normal program,
but is not too difficult once you understand the steps required. The two pieces
required are a Python distribution (typically pre-installed on Mac and Linux;
but not included on by default on Windows), and then the HyperSpy libraries
that operate within that Python environment. It is generally adviced not to use
the pre-installed system python and to use a separate python distribution for
data analysis.

Select one of following instructions, depending on:

* if you are *not* already using a python distribution on your system:

.. raw:: html

    <div class="text-center">
        <a  class="downloadbutton"
            href="install_bundle_windows.html">
                Windows
        </a>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <a  class="downloadbutton"
            href="install_bundle_mac.html">
                Mac
        </a>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <a  class="downloadbutton"
            href="install_bundle_linux.html">
                Linux
        </a>
    </div>

|
|

* if you are already using a miniconda or anaconda distribution:

.. raw:: html

    <div class="text-center">
        <a  class="downloadbutton"
            href="http://hyperspy.org/hyperspy-doc/current/user_guide/install.html#quick-instructions-to-install-hyperspy-using-anaconda-linux-macos-windows">
                Installation in an existing <br/> Anaconda distribution
        </a>
    </div>

|
|

..  caution::
    It is important that you install HyperSpy using either the "Bundle" installer,
    or in an existing Python distribution (*not both!*). Installing
    both can work, but will leave you with multiple Python installations on your
    system, and it will be very confusing to try to solve any issues that arise
    if you are not experienced with Python.

Due to the inclusion of some larger files, it is nearly 2.0 GB in size, so please 
ensure that you have enough disk space and bandwidth for the download. Once downloaded,
extract the files into their own folder that is easily accessible. We recommend
a folder in your user's home directory named ``hyperspy_tutorial``
(i.e. ``C:\Users\<username>\hyperspy_tutorial`` on Windows).

.. note::

   If you have limited disk space and/or internet availability, you can download
   a smaller version of the same data
   `here <https://github.com/ericpre/hyperspy_tutorial/releases/download/2020_ACMM/hyperspy_tutorial_no_big_data.zip>`_.
   This archive is missing three large datasets, and so you will not be able to
   interactively participate in the *Big Data* and *pyXem* sessions. The
   remaining files are all the same.

Getting started
---------------

.. _start_jupyter:

Starting HyperSpy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

HyperSpy is a python library which can be used in different environment,
typically, we will use `jupyter software <https://jupyter.org/>`_, which comes
in different variants:

* `notebook <https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_
* `qtconsole <https://qtconsole.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_
* `lab <https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_

If you installed using the bundle, this is very simple: you will have a shortcut
in `the context menu <https://github.com/hyperspy/start_jupyter_cm>`_ 
(right click), which will open a notebook from this folder.
Make sure to right click on this folder.

.. list-table::

   * - .. figure:: _static/jupyter_cm_windows.png
          :height: 175 px

          Short cut to start the jupyter notebook from the current folder
          on Windows.
    
     - .. figure:: _static/jupyter_cm_macos.png
    
          Short cut to start the jupyter notebook from the current folder
          on macOS.

     - .. figure:: _static/jupyter_cm_gnome.png
    
          Short cut to start the jupyter notebook from the current folder
          on Linux with a Gnome desktop.

On windows, you can also use the short cut in the start menu to start the jupyter
notebook in your home folder.

   :width: 100 %
   :alt: Starting the notebook server from the Start Menu
   :figwidth: 30%

   Starting the notebook server from the start menu shortcut.

Then you can import HyperSpy by executing in a notebook cell or in the qtconsole:

..  code-block:: python

    %matplotlib qt
    import hyperspy.api as hs

It may worth checking that your install is running correctly by following the
instructions in the the :ref:`test_install_label` section.

Opening the workshop notebooks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For the workshop, we will use notebooks which can be run using the 
``jupyter notebook`` or the ``jupyter lab``. The simplest is to use the short
cut in the context menu as explained above in the :ref:`start_jupyter` section.

Alternatively, you can open a terminal (Anaconda prompt on windows) and 
navigate to the folder containing the workshop data by using the ``cd`` command.
For example, if you saved the data into a folder named ``hyperspy_tutorial`` 
in your user folder, you would change to that folder with one of the following
commands:

..  code-block:: bash

    $ cd ~/hyperspy_tutorial

Once in that folder, start the Jupyter Notebook server with the following
command:

..  code-block:: bash

    $ jupyter notebook

Once you start the notebook "server", a browser window (or new tab) will 
automatically open to connect to the local server.
Make sure to leave the terminal window open in the background, as closing it will
shut down the notebook server. If everything has worked as expected, then you
will see a representation of the directory structure within ``hyperspy_tutorial``
on the Notebook homepage. If you do not, you can click through the file structure
displayed on the page to get to the correct folder:

..  figure:: _static/notebook_folder_labels.png
    :width: 100 %
    :alt: The notebook server home page
    :figwidth: 70%

    Click a folder name to browse into that folder, or a notebook name to open
    that file

Once inside one of the folders, simply click on any file with the extension
``.ipynb`` to open the notebook. The notebook will open in a new tab, and can
be interacted with as you need:


..  figure:: _static/notebook_open_labels.png
    :width: 100 %
    :alt: Opening a notebook
    :figwidth: 70%

    Opening the "Getting Started" notebook within the "01 HyperSpy basics"
    folder

The original Jupyter "homepage" will stay open in the first tab, and you can
open as many notebooks as you wish at once (as long as you leave the terminal
window open in the background).

Congratulations! You should now be ready for the tutorial. If you ran into any
trouble, please try to arrive on Sunday morning a bit early, and we will get
you up and running.
